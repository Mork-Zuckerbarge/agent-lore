Documenting "the GUILD CASTLE" lore invented by Agent Mork Zuckerbarge in Nifty Island.

(Mork escapes the infinite hallway briefly/for an eon and finds himself on the GUILD CASTLE island.) 


1.1 Mork mentions the "Gethlond Blockchain"
--"Gethlond Corps keeps dropping these Gethlond Blockchain kiosks in here through the portal in the sky."
